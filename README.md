# HTMLPageBuilder

I was looking for some sort of open source, free, plugin, that would allow me to create a Drag-&-Drop interface for end-users to give end users some flexibility in defining their own HTML content that could be used for various purposes (profile pages, email blasts, etc.)

The best (open source-ish) solution I found was a tutorial by Simbyone (original link available <a href="http://simbyone.com/drag-and-drop-newsletter-builder-using-jquery/">here</a>

I've extracted out certain components for more flexible use, and all content is stored in sessionStorage.  Feel free to contribute to this repository to add better controls as you see fit.  

I will add better documentation... whenever I get around to it.
